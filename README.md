# Produce Order Helper - Training Project

This app is meant to translate the letters and checkmarks on a paper grocery order, into a list of produce names and quantities.  

May 1, 2025.  
This is my third coding project.  
Here I have utilized a loop and a corresponding array to 
allow the "uncheck" button to uncheck the 60 checkboxes in one fell swoop - FUN times!  
I've gotten much more comfortable accessing (reading and writing) input elements.  
A big challenge in this project was writing the conditional statements to 
give the checkbox rows their autofilling behaviors: 
Click or tap a checkbox, and the checkboxes behind it get checked automatically. 
I can see lots of room for improving (refactoring) the project code to remove repetitions.  
Global variables: I've recently learned that globals are undesirable,
which I had no idea about when I started the project. 
The project code is stuffed to breaking with globals.  
Objects: the project uses none. But I'm ready to implement them, 
and I expect they will greatly reduce the source code.
Thanks for checking it out!
